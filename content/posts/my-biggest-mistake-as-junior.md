List of biggest fuck up during my time as junior engineer:
- Merging code to the master branch without testing it correctly (during internship)
- Not understanding the language & technology that I use correctly (during internship)
- Not reading the requirement correctly and simply just assuming the requirement (during first job)
- Scared to take on challenge (during internship)
- Afraid on saying no to a request
