Over the past year, I had been blogging on medium.com for my internship and its truly been a great learning experience. Sadly over the course of 2022, i need to focus on finishing my undergraduate studies and now becoming a full time software engineer at a startup in Indonesia (where I live). Alot of things are changing real fast and it was scary to say, at least from my perspective. With how fast things changes and how much I had learnt this past few month, I would like to express myself, from technical things (programming) to my daily life routine. 

From the reader / community perspective, I will give alot of different content from when I was a year ago. As previously I like to share about data science stuff (in medium) based from my experience in the job as a data science intern. Nowadays, it will be more about software engineering stuff, like the problems that I tackled in the job or just some personal ranting about software engineer in general. 

This blog is built using Hugo, hosted at Netlify. And i took a lot of inspiration from ![openmymind.net](https://www.openmymind.net/) and ![Will Larson](https://lethain.com/), both blog had been inspiring for me to start the blogging journey myself.
